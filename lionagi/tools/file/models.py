------------------
The request for the 'ReaderTool'. Mainly used for opening docs from a 
file or URL or reading a partial slice of the already-opened docs. Some clever 
one-round caveats:\n
1. Open a doc and reading one or more slices of the opened doc, by putting in a
list of action requests with the same doc_id, first action should be 
'open' or 'scrape' and the rest should be 'read'. With 'sequential' action strategy.
2. Manipulating multiple docs at once. By putting in a list of action requests of 
different doc_id. With 'concurrent'/'batch' action strategy.
3. Manipulating multiple docs in sequence. By putting in a list of action requests
of different doc_id. With 'sequential' action strategy. You can also
combine the two strategies together.
