       "Certainly! Here are some FastAPI coding questions that you can use to assess the skills of software engineer candidates:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Basic Endpoint Creation:**\n",
       "   - Create a simple FastAPI application with a single GET endpoint that returns a JSON response with a greeting message.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Path and Query Parameters:**\n",
       "   - Develop an endpoint that accepts a path parameter and a query parameter. The path parameter should be a username, and the query parameter should be an optional age. Return a personalized greeting message based on these parameters.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Data Validation with Pydantic:**\n",
       "   - Design a POST endpoint that accepts a JSON payload representing a user profile (e.g., name, email, age). Use Pydantic models to validate the input data and return a success message if the data is valid.\n",
       "\n",
       "4. **Dependency Injection:**\n",
       "   - Implement a FastAPI endpoint that uses dependency injection to access a mock database connection. Demonstrate how to use this dependency in the endpoint to fetch and return data.\n",
       "\n",
       "5. **Error Handling:**\n",
       "   - Create an endpoint that raises a custom HTTPException when a certain condition is met (e.g., if a required query parameter is missing). Show how to handle this exception and return a meaningful error response.\n",
       "\n",
       "6. **Middleware Implementation:**\n",
       "   - Write a middleware function that logs the details of each incoming request (e.g., method, URL, and timestamp) and demonstrate its integration into a FastAPI application.\n",
       "\n",
       "7. **Background Tasks:**\n",
       "   - Develop an endpoint that triggers a background task to send an email notification. Use FastAPI's `BackgroundTasks` to handle the asynchronous execution of this task.\n",
       "\n",
       "8. **File Upload:**\n",
       "   - Create an endpoint that allows users to upload a file. Validate the file type and size, and return a response indicating whether the upload was successful.\n",
       "\n",
       "9. **Authentication and Authorization:**\n",
       "   - Implement a basic authentication mechanism using OAuth2 with password flow. Create a protected endpoint that requires a valid token to access.\n",
       "\n",
       "10. **WebSocket Communication:**\n",
       "    - Set up a WebSocket endpoint that allows clients to connect and receive real-time updates. Demonstrate how to send messages to connected clients.\n",
       "\n",
       "These questions cover a range of FastAPI features and can help evaluate a candidate's understanding of the framework and their ability to implement practical solutions."

       "- **FastAPI Instance Creation**: We create an instance of FastAPI called `app` to configure our project.\n",
       "- **Product Pydantic Model**: The `Product` model is defined using Pydantic to structure the JSON response, specifying `product_id` and `name` as the keys.\n",
       "- **Define Endpoint**: The `/product` endpoint is created using `@app.get()`, indicating it’s a GET request. We specify `response_model=Product` to ensure the response conforms to the `Product` structure.\n",
       "- **Function Implementation**: In the `get_product()` function, a sample product data dictionary is created and returned, which matches the structure of the `Product` model.\n",
       "- **Running the App**: To run the application and test the endpoint, use the Uvicorn command in the terminal provided in the comment within the code.\n",
       "\n",
       "This setup ensures that the application aligns with best practices and leverages FastAPI’s features for validation and structured response."
